# What Happens When You Type Google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive exploration of the web stack that powers the internet. It demonstrates the complete journey of a web request from the moment you type `https://www.google.com` in your browser and press Enter until the page loads in front of you.

## Project Description

This classic software engineering interview question serves as an excellent test of understanding how various components of the web infrastructure work together. The project covers the entire web stack, from DNS resolution to database queries, providing insight into the complex orchestration of modern web services.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will understand:

- **DNS Resolution**: How domain names are translated to IP addresses
- **TCP/IP**: The foundation protocols of internet communication  
- **Firewall**: Security measures protecting network infrastructure
- **HTTPS/SSL**: Encryption protocols securing data transmission
- **Load Balancer**: Distribution of traffic across multiple servers
- **Web Server**: Handling of HTTP requests and serving static content
- **Application Server**: Processing of dynamic content and business logic
- **Database**: Data storage and retrieval systems

## Project Tasks

### Task 0: Blog Post
**File**: `0-blog_post`
